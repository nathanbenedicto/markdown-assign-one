First Markdown Assignment | ENGG 21-E

# INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Form a group of 4 to 5 students. 
2. Publish an R Markdown on RPubs and submit the link. Only one member of the group should publish and send the RPubs link but EVERYONE MUST CONTRIBUTE on its contents.
3. Within the markdown document, each member should answer the following questions.
  3.1 Aside from the reasons mentioned in class, why do we need to study and analyze data?
  3.2 Cite atleast one instance or application where data science was used and contributed on policy-making, day-to-day decisions, knowing market trends, and scientific researches.
  3.3 Propose atleast one data science topic that you want to pursue: Have a broad description of the topic, describe the availability of the data, what kinds of statistical method you think you will need, and who would benefit this study.

Be creative. You can use markdown templates and cheat sheets to be able to add images, links, or anything that you think is necessary to answer these questions.
